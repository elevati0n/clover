My name is Clover Fields.

I'm 28, and I'm from Los Angeles, California.
I am a tattoo artist, a fine artist, and part owner of miss u tattoo.

I have a background in Graphic Design, a deep passion for editing and organizing,
and I'm always interested in getting involved in diy projects however I can.
